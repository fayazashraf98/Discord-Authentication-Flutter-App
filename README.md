# Discord-Authentication-Flutter-App
This Flutter project demonstrates how to integrate Discord OAuth2 authentication into a Flutter app using the PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) flow. Users can log in using their Discord account, and upon successful authentication, their basic profile data is displayed. A logout button allows users to clear the displayed information.
